    This page defines the mechanisms providers can use to assist patients with their physical activvity levels if measurements indicate
    that intervention is called for.  There are three main mechanisms defined:
	</p>
	<ul>
    <li>creating <a href="orders">exercise prescriptions</a> detailing what level of physical activity a patient should performing on
      a regular basis</li>
    <li>setting <a href="plans">plans and goals</a> with the patient and their supports around what their physical activity level should
      look like - and how they can realistically get there, and</li>
    <li>creating <a href="referrals">referrals</a> to physical activity specialists who can help a patient to achieve their
      physical activity targets in a manner that meets their physical limitations, lifestyle and interests</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These three types of interventions can be used separately or in concert to help patients achieve a healthy level of physical activity.
  </p>
  
  <a name="orders"> </a>
  <h3>Exercise Prescriptions</h3>
  <p>
    Sometimes all that's necessary to help a patient to improve their level of physicial activity is to have their clinician formally
    prescribe it, in much the same way as they might prescribe a medication or physiotherapy.  [Todo - add references to literature supporting
    this.]
  </p>
  <p>
    In FHIR, orders for physical actions are represented using the <a href="StructureDefinition-pa-servicerequest.html">ServiceRequest profile</a>.
    In the case of an exercise referral, the ServiceRequest 'performer' would be the patient themselves.  The requested activity would be
    exercise therapy (SNOMED 229065009), possibly with more specific textual details as to the type of physical activity to perform, along
    with timing information - e.g. 150 minutes/week conveyed in the effectiveTiming element.
  </p>
  <p>
    While in many cases there is no need for such orders to be exchanged electronically, it may be useful for others, particuarly physical
    activity service providers involved in the patient's care to be aware of the existence of the order so they can support the patient in 
    performing it.  Therefore, this specification supports the electronic retrieval of exercise prescriptions by both 
    <a href="CapabilityStatement-pa-referral-recipient.html">Referral Recipient</a> and 
    <a href="CapabilityStatement-pa-patient-engagement.html">Patient Engagement</a> systems.
  </p>

  <a name="plans"> </a>
  <h3>Plans and Goals</h3>
  <p>
    A key step in improving a patient's physical activity levels are establishing and monitoring against goals for a desired level of
    physical activity and agreeing on a plan to attain that level of activity.  In some cases, these might be established and maintained
    only in the system of the <a href="CapabilityStatement-pa-care-manager.html">care manager</a> and merely be retrieved by the 
    <a href="CapabilityStatement-pa-referral-recipient.html">Referral Recipient</a> and 
    <a href="CapabilityStatement-pa-patient-engagement.html">Patient Engagement</a> systems.  However, in some environments, Referral
    Recipients and/or patients themselves might be able to create and/or update goals and update care plans.  This standard supports
    these actions, but leaves it to organizational policy which types of actions can be performed by which users.  Even if updating is
    permitted, there may be limitations on which elements can be changed.  (For example, changing the 'subject' of a goal or care plan
    typically won't be allowed by anyone, with the possible exception of technical staff at a provider site who manage patient merges
    and splits or otherwise addressing record errors.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this implementation guide, both goals and plans are relatively simple, with only a small subset of the potential data elements
    expected to be supported.  These expectations are reflected in the physcial activity <a href="pa-goal.html">goal</a> and 
    <a href="pa-careplan.html">care plan</a> profiles.  Systems are free to support additional data elements, but cannot presume that
    other participants will also support them without site-specific negotiation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The purpose of the CarePlan resource is to allow a shared understanding of what actions the patient (and those around them) will take
    to help improve their level of physical activity.  This can be expressed as simple narrative.  The plan can be updated to reflect
    changes based on patient need and on what's working - or isn't working.
  </p>
  <p>
    Goals allow a shared understanding of a target level of physical activity.  These might be ongoing goals to be sustained or might
    be target goals to be achieved by a particular point in time.  Over time, goals may change their state, to reflect progress as
    well as whether they are considered an 'active' goal or not.  This information might be reflected by the patient, a physical
    activity professional and/or their care manager.
  </p>

  <a name="referrals"> </a>
  <h3>Referrals</h3>
  <p>
    Referrals are the process by which one practitioner asks another practitioner to provide a type of care for a patient.  In the
    case of this implementation guide, this will be the <a href="CapabilityStatement-pa-care-manager.html">Care Manager</a> seeking
    the services of a <a href="CapabilityStatement-pa-referral-recipient.html">Referral Recipient</a>.  In cases where a Referral
    Recipient delegates and solicits care from a different Referral Recipient, then for the purposes of this implementation guide,
    they take on the role of being a Care Manager.  (Some insurers or other programs may place limits on what types of practitioners
    they consider to be authorized to create referrals.  This implemenation guide does not establish such limitations.)
  </p>
  <p>
    The referral process consists of two steps: the referral 'authorization' and the actual request for the desired practitioner to
    satisfy the authorization.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first step must be done by an 'authorized' practitioner - someone who has the
    training and often the licensure to determine that a particular service is necessary and appropriate.  They document the
    service to be performed, who it is to be delivered to, the timeframe in which it is to be delivered, and any other instructions.
    For physical activity-related services, this will always be a ServiceRequest resource corresponding to the
    <a href="StructureDefinition-pa-servicerequest.html">Physical Activity Referral</a> profile.
  </p>
  <p>
    The beneficiary of the service will typically be the patient, but in some cases it might be some other caregiver who assists the
    patient.  For example, providing counselling or training to a spouse or other family member who can assist the patient in
    their physical activity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The service and timing of the service are encoded to allow some degree of automated computability (to help find who can perform
    the service, to decide whether the targeted performer can deliver the service in the desired timeframe, and perhaps most importantly,
    to determine whether the service is covered by insurance).  However, additional detail can be provided in free text.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second step is conducted using a Task resource that adheres to the 
    <a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.sdoh}}StructureDefinition-SDOHCC-TaskForReferralManagement.html">SDOH Task</a> profile.  The task 
    is used for the conversation where the Care Manager asks the Referral Recipient "Can you please satisfy this referral?" and the
    Referral Recipient has the option of responding 'yes' or 'no' and eventually reporting back on how things went.  This step <i>might</i>
    be initiated by the same practitioner who created the referral, but quite often this 'dispatching' process is managed by nurses,
    receptionists or other back-end staff.
  </p>
  <p>
    A key distinguishing feature of the 'Task' portion of the workflow is that fulfillment of the same order might be sought more than
    once.  For example, initially a Task might be directed to Service Provider A, who refuses the task because of availability issues
    or because they no longer provide the desired service.  A new Task (pointing to the same ServiceRequest) might then be spawned
    seeking fulfillment of the referral by Service Provider B.  Service Provider B might initially accept the referral but then later
    cancel because the service provider moves locations.  Finally a third Task might be created seeking fulfillment by Service Provider C
    who accepts and delivers the needed service.  Only when that third Task is completed and the ordering clinician is satisfied that their
    objectives have been satisfied would the original ServiceRequest be marked as 'completed'.
  </p>
  <p>
    Further details describing the specific processes involved in creating and sharing referrals can be found in the
    <a href="workflow.html#referral">Workflow</a> section of this implementation guide.
  </p>
  
  <a name="procedure"> </a>
  <h3>Services</h3>
  <p>
    The objective of a referral is always to have a service (or perhaps a set of services) performed.  In FHIR, all physical activity-
    related interventions are represented as Procedure instances that conforms to the <a href="StructureDefinition-pa-procedure">physical
    activity procedure</a> profile.  This resource allows documentation of exactly what was done and when.  It will often provide a more
    detailed description of the action(s) performed than what was ordered in the original referral.  The creation of the procedure records
    describing the interventions performed and linking those as 'outputs' of the Task seeking fulfillment of the referral helps to close
    the loop on the referral and also provides records that may be needed for billing.
