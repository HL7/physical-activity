    For many readers, the notion that physical activity is important to healthcare outcomes, and that prescribing increased physical activity will
    improve healthcare outcomes may be taken as a given.  However, for those who are interested in some of the supporting research (perhaps to help
    make the case for implementing this implementation guide in their own organization), this page provides more detail about existing evidence,
    complete with citations.

    may differ somewhat.

  <h3>Physical Activity and Health</h3>
  <p>
    Being regularly physically active is one of the most important health behaviors people can engage in to maintain physical health, mental health, 
    and well-being.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>  Regular physical activity (PA) is both health-promoting and important for disease treatment and 
    prevention with numerous benefits that contribute to a disability-free lifespan.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>  New research shows that more than 
    110,000 lives could be saved annually if adults in the U.S. increased their physical activity by just ten minutes per day.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>  
    Physical activity reduces the risk of several of the leading causes of death and disability, including cardiovascular disease and colon, breast, 
    and endometrial cancers.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>  Physical activity is also important for improving outcomes for the approximately 2/3 of 
    Americans who have a chronic condition. For example, physical activity improves survival from breast cancer<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> and 
    several aspects of quality of life for a broader range of cancers.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>   Despite the many benefits of physical activity, 
    we know that youth physical activity decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>  The overall prevalence of physical 
    inactivity among adults in our nation is alarmingly high (25.3 percent), and significant disparities exist among race/ethnic groups (e.g., 
    non-Hispanic Asian adults, 20.1 percent; non-Hispanic White, 23.0 percent; non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native, 29.1 percent; non-Hispanic 
    Black, 30.0 percent; and Hispanic adults, 32.1 percent).<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>
  </p>
  <img style="float:right;padding:3px" src="training.png"  height="340" alt="A woman holding an exercise ball being coached by a man"/>
  <p>
    A recent systematic review has shown convincingly that physical activity significantly reduces the risk of more severe clinical outcomes in those 
    infected with severe COVID.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>  Recent studies show that PA is associated with strong immune response, risk reduction 
    from community-acquired infectious disease and mortality, and increased vaccine potency.<sup><a href="#10">10</a>, <a href="#11">11</a>, 
    <a href="#12">12</a></sup>  It also contributes to social connectedness, quality of life, and environmental sustainability.<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>  
    Currently in the U.S., only 26 percent of men, 19 percent of women, and 20 percent of adolescents report sufficient activity to meet the relevant 
    guidelines for aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> Even so, current population PA levels avert 3.9 million premature deaths globally and 
    140,200 premature deaths in the U.S. on an annual basis.<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    If all Americans met current physical activity guidelines, 
    Medicare could save $73.9 billion per year.<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup>  In one study of older adults including over 50,000 patients, total 
    average healthcare expenses were significantly reduced by 16% for fitness program participants compared to non-participating Medicare Advantage 
    members. The study's findings showed total annual average health expenses, including medical and pharmacy, among program participants to be $4,463 
    compared to $5,303 for non-participants. Medical component of costs was decreased by 26%, driven primarily by reductions in hospitalization costs. Use 
    of outpatient care was higher for participants combined with less acute care, indicating better health management among participants compared to 
    non-participants. Participants also performed significantly better on key quality measures including all-cause 30-day readmissions, adherence to 
    hypertension and cholesterol medications, diabetes care (HbA1c testing and eye exams), and many preventive screening measures including colonoscopy, 
    depression, cholesterol, breast cancer, and prostate cancer screening when compared to non-participants.<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Low PA and low fitness also pose immediate and long-term threats to our nation’s safety and security. At this time, 71 percent of Americans ages 17-24 
    fail to meet core eligibility requirements for entrance into the military, creating a serious recruiting deficit.<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup>  
    Among those who do meet basic requirements for service, musculoskeletal injuries associated with low fitness levels have costed the Department of 
    Defense hundreds of millions of dollars,<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup>  and have been identified as the most significant medical impediment to 
    military readiness.<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup>
  </p>

  <h3>Importance of Measuring Physical Activity</h3>
  <p>
    Despite the abundance of evidence on the importance of physical activity for individuals of all ages, races and abilities,<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> 
    our current healthcare system lacks a set of standardized measures for physical activity that can be incorporated into electronic health record (EHR) 
    systems and easily utilized by healthcare clinicians.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> As a result, millions of Americans lack appropriate counseling and 
    prescription for active living that would not only prevent or manage most of the chronic diseases and their associated risk factors, but also improve
    mental health and well-being. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Improving population levels of physical activity requires comprehensive efforts to maximize the potential benefits of setting-specific interventions 
    under a coordinated multilevel approach across the healthcare system and community and home-based resources.<sup><a href="#20">20</a>, 
    <a href="#21">21</a></sup>   Numerous guidelines and recommendations, including the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup> 
    the US Preventive Services Task Force,<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup> the Healthy People 2030 Framework,<sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup> and the US 
    National Physical Activity Plan<sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup> promote the importance of PA screening, assessment, and prescription as a standard of 
    care in clinical practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    In response to common barriers to effectively deliver complex PA counseling solely in clinical settings, programs have integrated referral of patients 
    to community-based physical activity resources and programs.<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup> These exercise referral schemes have also shown 
    effectiveness.<sup><a href="#26">26</a>, <a href="#27">27</a></sup>  Compared with usual care, more patients who received referrals for exercise by 
    their primary care providers achieved PA recommendations (relative risk, 1.16), and experienced reduced depression.<sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup> 
    Heath and colleagues<sup><a href="#28">28</a></sup> examined the feasibility of a clinic-based Physical Activity Vital Sign (PAVS) assessment and 
    referral protocol to YMCA exercise programming compared with PAVS alone in a sample of adult patients seen for primary care visits in a southeastern 
    US health system. They found improvements in self-reported PA after 12 weeks in the PAVS plus referral group (P&lt;0.02).  The specific exercise
    vital sign measure proposed for this implementation guide has been tested and found to correctly identify the majority of adults who do and do not meet 
    physical activity guidelines.<sup><a href="#29">29</a></sup>  Other meta-analyses and 
    systematic reviews have shown that physician counseling (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–1.73) and exercise referral systems (risk 
    ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.35) promote improvements in patients’ PA for up to 12 months.<sup><a href="#26">26</a>, <a href="#30">30</a>, 
    <a href="#31">31</a></sup>
