    This page presents a number of real-world scenarios that show how the features of this implementation guide could be used to help
    support patients in achieving improved physical activity.  These scenarios are not exhaustive.  The data exchange mechanisms defined in this IG
    can be combined in a variety of ways and are in no way limited to the specific combinations described below.  Rather, the intention is
    to show how the functionality enabled by this IG <i>could</i> be used to improve patient care.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of these scenarios envision insurance coverage, technical infrastructure, and applications that are not yet in existence or
    not yet widespread.  Usage of this implementation guide is not dependent on these features, though their availability will ease the use
    of this guide and magnify its impact on patient care.
  </p>
  <p>
    All scenarios in this implementation guide attempt to represent realistic patient scenarios, but are not based on real patients or real
    patient data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each scenario describes a series of interactions between a patient and their clinicians and/or exercise professionals.  Following the
    'story' of their interactions is an explanation of how the functionality described in this implementation guide supports or enables the
    capabilities described in the story.  Each scenario also identifies places where functionality described in other implementation guides
    might come into play and alternate technical mechanisms that could have been used within this implementation guide to produce similar
    effects.  The trade-offs associated with these different alternatives often have a more detailed discussion in the
    <a href="design.html">Design Considerations</a> page of this implementation guide.

  <h3>Exercise Prescription</h3>
  <img style="float:right;padding:3px" src="provider-patient.png" alt="Picture of clinician and patient across a desk from each other"/>
  <p>
    Mr. Khatun is a 55 year-old male weighing 190 lb, with a height of 5' 6".  This gives him a body-mass index just over 30.  At his
    anual physical exam, his clinician Dr. Patel notes that this, combined with his high blood pressure puts him at increased risk for heart attack.
    He reviews the results of the electronic intake survey Mr. Khatun had completed and notes that his physical activity vital sign showed
    an average of only 20 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity and asked him more about his activity levels.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mr. Khatun indicates that, since his children had gotten older, he has less incentive to be outside and doing things, and that his job is
    largely sedentary.  Dr. Patel explains that Mr. Khatun's activity levels are far below the weekly target to maintain good health and that increasing 
    his physical activity levels, plus some adjustments to his diet, could improve his weight, lower his blood pressure, as well help him to feel 
    more energetic.  
  </p>
  <p>
    The two of them spend a few minutes discussing activities Mr. Khatun had enjoyed in the past and how he might increase his physical activity level
    without his children to drive that behavior.  Dr. Patel captures those ideas in his notes.  The two of them agree to schedule their next visit in 6 
    months and that by then, Mr. Khatun would aim to be doing at least 100 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise.  At the conclusion of his visit,
    Mr. Khatun receives a brochure with a QI-code link to an app he can use to track his physical activity.  Dr. Patel also provides him a formal 
    prescription for exercise, indicating "This prescription is as important as any medication or lab test, only this one can be free - and even fun."
  </p>
  <p>
    At home, Mr. Khatun downloads and installs the app and, after logging in with the email address he'd given the clinic receptionist, he
    sees that the plan and target exercise level, as well as a copy of his "exercise prescription" have automatically been downloaded into the
    app.  Over the course of the next 6 months, he tracks his exercise levels which are stored in an app-specific personal health record (PHR).
    Heart-rate and step counts are automatically propagated from his phone.  Mr. Khatun opts to allow the high-level summary information to flow to
    Dr. Patel's electronic health record (EHR). By the time he returns to the clinic for his 6-month touchpoint, the doctor
    can see in his EHR that Mr. Khatun has not only met, but exceeded his goal.  The doctor congratulates him on his progress, the fact he's lost 10 
    pounds, and that his blood pressure is starting to come down.  They set to work adjusting his plan and set a new target, this time for
    Mr. Khatun to reach the guideline target of 175 minutes/week.
  </p>
  
  <a name="provider-patient-fit"> </a>
  <h4>How this IG applies</h4>
  <p>
    Mr. Khatun's app performed a <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}search.html">search</a> operation on the EHR's FHIR endpoint to retrieve CarePlan,
    Goal and ServiceRequest resources that complied with the <a href="structuredefinition-pa-careplan.html">exercise plan</a>, 
    <a href="structuredefinition-pa-goal.html">goal</a>, and <a href="structuredefinition-pa-servicerequest.html">exercise prescription</a> 
    profiles defined in this guide.  In all three cases, the search parameters included Mr. Khatun's Patient.id as determined by the log-in process 
    as well as a category filter retrieving only those plans, goals and orders related to "physical activity".
  </p>
  <p>
    The exercise levels and supporting information captured by Mr. Khatun's app were propagated to the app's PHR storage system using
    the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}http.html#create">create</a> operation with the 
    <a href="StructureDefinition-observation-evs-days-per-week.html">Days-per-week</a>,
    <a href="StructureDefinition-observation-evs-min-per-day.html">Minutes-per-day</a>,
    <a href="StructureDefinition-observation-min-per-week.html">Minutes-per-week</a>, and
    <a href="StructureDefinition-observation-strength-days-per-week.html">Strength Days-per-day</a> profiles, as well as with the
    <a href="StructureDefinition-pa-time-measure.html">Time-based observation</a> profile and the constraints established for heart rate
    and step count measures in the <a href="measures.html#time-based-measures">Time-based measures</a> section of this implementation guide.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the clinician opted not to receive the daily heart rate and exercise log information, his EHR did receive the
    <a href="measures.html#base">base measures</a> defined in this IG, including the physical activity vital sign.  These Observations were
    transmitted to the EHR with a <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}http.html#create">create</a> operation using the
    <a href="StructureDefinition-observation-evs-days-per-week.html">Days-per-week</a>,
    <a href="StructureDefinition-observation-evs-min-per-day.html">Minutes-per-day</a>,
    <a href="StructureDefinition-observation-min-per-week.html">Minutes-per-week</a>, and
    <a href="StructureDefinition-observation-strength-days-per-week.html">Strength Days-per-day</a>.
  </p>

  <a name="provider-patient-alternatives"> </a>
  <h4>Alternatives</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The clinician could also have opted to receive the more frequent <a href="measures.html#support">supporting measures</a> as well.</li>
    <li>Rather than having a copy of the base and supporting measures created in her EHR, Dr. Patel's EHR could have performed a 
      <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}search.html">search</a> operation on 
      the personal health record backing Mr. Khatun's app and viewed his exercise information Observations that way.</li>
    <li>Instead of storing Mr. Khatun's exercise information in a personal health record, the app could have been configured to store the information
      in Dr. Patel's EHR directly.</li>
    <li>If Dr. Patel's EHR had granted the necessary permissions, Mr. Khatun could have <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}http.html#update">updated</a>
      his goals or <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}http.html#create">created</a> a new one once it became evident that he was up for more of a

  <h3>Provider Refers to Exercise Physiologist</h3>
  <p>
    Mrs. Johanson is a 63-year old female who is recovering after suffering a mild heart attack.  Her cardiologist, Dr. Lopez  lets her know 
    that she's sufficiently recovered to begin exercising again, and that doing so is an important step in getting her heart back to a healthier
    state.  Mrs. Johanson confides that she no longer feels confident exercising in the way she once did, and feels uncertain about the best
    way to get back to her previous levels of physical activity as some activities she used to enjoy now feel uncomfortable.
  </p>
  <img style="float:left;padding:3px" src="physiologist-referral.png" alt="Picture of older woman lifting a weight being guided and coached by a man"/>
  <p>
    Dr. Lopez writes a referral for Mrs. Johanson to see an exercise physiologist to work with her to help her safely resume her previous activities
    or find alternatives she will enjoy that better accomodate her changed health status.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dr. Lopez's nurse, Mr. Holland accesses a regional provider directory to retrieve a list of candidate exercise physiologists.  He first sends
    a request to Mrs. Wang whose office is closest to Mrs. Johanson's home address.  However, he shortly after receives a notification that Mrs.
    Wang's earliest opening was two months later than the referral window.  Trying again, he sends a request to Mr. Matthews who is slightly
    further away, but still a workable distance.  Mr. Matthews' clerk retrieves the referral and, after consulting briefly with Mr. Matthews and
    submitting a prior authorization to ensure coverage, returns an acceptance of the referral.  Shortly thereafter, Mrs. Johanson receives a phone 
    call from Mr. Matthews office to schedule her initial appointment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the course of a few appointments, Mr. Matthews works with Mrs. Johanson and helps her to better understand which types of discomfort
    she should gently work through and which types signal a need to change her approach to exercise.  With some tips and adjustments, she's soon
    able to resume exercising in a manner similar to what she was previously accustomed and is slowly working her way towards the level
    of vigor and frequency she had enjoyed prior to her heart issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mr. Matthews writes up a short report, summarizing his interactions with Mrs. Johanson, noting his recommended adjustments to her exercise
    routine as well as the targets the two of them had agreed to in terms of returning to an appropriate level of physical activity.  He sends
    the report to Dr. Lopez and bills Mrs. Johanson's insurance for his services.
  </p>

  <a name="physiologist-referral-fit"> </a>
  <h4>How this IG applies</h4>
  <p>
    The referral is exposed by Dr. Lopez's EHR as a ServiceRequest adhering to the <a href="structuredefinition-pa-servicerequest.html">referral</a>
    profile defined in this guide.  When the nurse reaches out to Mrs. Wang and Mr. Matthews, the EHR also stores a record exposed as a Task compliant with the
    <a href="StructureDefinition-pa-task-for-referral-management.html">Task for Referral Management</a> profile.  The EHR automatically notifies the
    physiologists' practice managers by email (either due to a pre-existing <a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.sub}}/index.html">subscription</a> on the EHR or 
    through custom configuration).  The practice manager then triggers their system to <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}search.html">search</a> the EHR
    to retrieve both the Task and the referenced Service Request so that the referral can be evaluated.
  </p>
  <p>
    In both cases, the exercise physiologists' systems perform an <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}http.html#update">update</a> on the EHR, changing
    the Task.  In Mrs. Wang's case, the <code>Task.status</code> is set to "refused" and a <code>Task.statusReason.text</code> string is provided
    explaining the lack of availability.  In Mr. Matthews' case, the <code>Task.status</code> is set to "accepted".
  </p>
  <p>
    Once Mr. Matthews has written the report his system performs a <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}http.html#create">create</a> of a DiagnosticReport on
    Dr. Lopez's EHR's endpoint, following the <a href="StructureDefinition-pa-diagnosticreport.html">intervention report</a> profile.  It then updates
    the previously retrieved Task and changes the <code>Task.status</code> to "completed" and adds a <code>Task.output</code> that points to the newly
    created DiagnosticReport, closing the referral loop.
  </p>

  <a name="physiologist-referral-alternatives"> </a>
  <h4>Alternatives</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Rather than receiving an email, either or both of the physiologists' systems might have received the subscription notification in a computable
      way by using a rest-hook or websocket <a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.sub}}/StructureDefinition-backport-subscription.html">subscription</a>.  In that
      case, the queries could have happened automatically and the data been available to the practice managers without further action being required.</li>
    <li>Instead of storing the Task locally in the EHR, the Task could have been <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}http.html#create">created</a> on the 
      exercise physiologist's system instead.  In that case, the physiologist system would only have needed to perform a search or a
      <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}http.html#read">read</a> to retrieve the referral referenced by the Task and changes to the Task status could have
      been made locally without any need for a FHIR operation.  However, Dr. Lopez's EHR would have needed to either create a subscription using the
      <a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.sdoh}}/checking_task_status.html#task-topic">Task topic</a> on the physiologists' systems or
      <a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.sdoh}}/checking_task_status.html#polling">polled</a> those systems in order to receive updates on when the Task had
      changed.</li>
    <li>Rather than only submitting a report when Mrs. Johanson had finished her visits, Mr. Matthews could have updated the Task to provide interim
      updates on progress, by updating the <code>Task.status</code> to "in-progress" when she had her first visit and/or by providing an interim
      report (using the same process as the final report, but not yet updating the <code>Task.status</code> to "completed").</li>
  </ul>
  
  <a name="physiologist-referral-others"> </a>
  <h4>Where other specifications may fit</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The lookup of potential exercise physiologists based on geographic distance from the patient's home is a function that should be supported by the
      <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/directory-exchange">National Healthcare Directory Exchange</a> IG.</li>
    <li>Monitoring for Task updates and changes will likely be managed using subscriptions, as defined in the
      <a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.sub}}">Subscription Backport</a> IG</li>
    <li>The prior authorization check process could be done using the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd">Coverage Requirements Discovery (CRD)</a>, 
      <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd">Documentation, Templates, and Rules (DTR)</a>,

  <h3>Patient Seeks Referral for Exercise Program</h3>
  <img style="float:right;padding:3px" src="program-referral.png" alt="Picture of a man participating in a group fitness program"/>
  <p>
    Mr. Shevchenko is a 43-year-old male who has recently recovered from prostate cancer.  A friend he'd met during chemo
    mentions that their neighborhood fitness center offers a program for cancer survivors to help them recover some of
    the muscle mass they've lost during treatment and get their bodies back into a healthier state.  Mr. Schevchenko shows up
    at a class to see about registering, however the receptionist informs him that, for liability reasons, a referral is
    required to participate in the program.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mr. Schevchenko uses his patient portal to send a message to his general practitioner, Dr. Blackrock.  The clinician looks
    up the program details on the fitness center website.  Based on the Mr. Schevchenko's most recent exam, Dr. Blackrock feels that
    the program is a good fit for his patient's current stage of recovery and happily writes up the referral and transmits a notification to
    the fitness center, then sends a reply to Mr. Schevchenk. He also makes a mental note of the program as something he wants to 
    recommend to a couple of his other patients.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following week, Mr. Schevchenko visits the fitness center again.  The receptionist welcomes him and gives him some basic
    instructions for the class, then shares the good news that the program is covered under contract by his insurer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mr. Schevchenko completes the 10 week program, and while not fully back to his old self, feels like he's well on his way.  He
    signs up for a fitness membership and makes plans to attend regularly with a few new friends he's met during his initial class.
  </p>
  
  <a name="program-referral-fit"> </a>
  <h4>How this IG applies</h4>
  <p>
    The flow here is much the same as the first part of the previous scenario.  The referral is exposed by Dr. BlackRock's EHR as a ServiceRequest 
    adhering to the <a href="structuredefinition-pa-servicerequest.html">referral</a>.  The 'notification' to the fitness center is again
    through a Task adhering to the <a href="StructureDefinition-pa-task-for-referral-management.html">Task for Referral Management</a> profile, 
    though in this case it is transmitted directly to the fitness center's FHIR API with a <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}http.html#create">create</a>.
    The fitness center's system performs a <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}html.html#read">read</a> of the EHR to retrieve the referenced
    ServiceRequest.    
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike Mrs. Johanson's previous scenario, the fitness center considers the 'referral' complete once Mr. Schevchenko has
    enrolled in the program and therefore <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}html.html#update">updates</a> the Task to reflect that
    new status once Mr. Schevchenko arrives for his first class.  The design of the fitness center program also does not have funding to support
    writing up reports, so no DiagnosticReport is created.  "Closing the loop" on the referral will have to wait until Mr. Chevchenko's next
    appointment with Dr. Blackrock when he can ask how things went.
  </p>

  <a name="program-referral-alternatives"> </a>
  <h4>Alternatives</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The various alternatives to which system the Task is stored on and how different parties are notified when it is updated or changed
      are the same as in the <a href="physiologist-referral-alternatives">physiologist referral</a>.</li>
    <li>While a report is unlikely in this situation, Dr. Blackstone could still keep some degree of tabs on Mr. Schevchenko's progress if
      he leveraged an app like the one described in the <a href="provider-patient">exercise prescription scenario</a> by watching the
      observations of weekly exercise or even specific exercise events.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <a name="program-referral-others"> </a>
  <h4>Where other specifications may fit</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Like the <a href="physiologist-referral-others">physiologist scenario</a>, the National Directory specification would be helpful in
      allowing Dr. Blackrock's system to find the endpoint for the fitness center and the Da Vinci Burden Reduction specifications might be
      helpful in allowing the fitness center to determine that Mr. Schevchenko's plan covered him.  Subscription backport would be relevant
      for monitoring Tasks.</li>

  <h3>Patient Works with Personal Trainer</h3>
  <img style="float:left;padding:3px" src="personal-trainer.png" alt="A woman pedalling an exercise bike in a fitness center, receiving 
    instructions from another woman"/>
  <p>
    Ms. Scarborough is a 32-year-old female in good physical health, however she's dealing with the loss of a relative from a stroke.  She's
    also just moved to a new city due to work.  She's aware that her new living circumstances and the demands of her job are going to make
    maintaining her previous fitness regime difficult, but she's been recently reminded of the importance of maintaining a sufficient focus
    on keeping up her own health and well-being.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her new job has a "health spending account" benefit that covers a range of healthcare-related benefits, including the services of a
    personal trainer.  Ms. Scarborough meets with a few of them and chooses Ms. Rocha as someone whose style and approach is a good match
    for her own.  The two of them meet together and put together a plan to explore a variety of exercise programs to figure out which
    components will help Ms. Scarborough to meet her fitness objectives in her environment and time constraints.  Ms. Rocha also helps
    Ms. Scarborough to set up an app that will allow Ms. Rocha to monitor how things are going.
  </p>
  <p>
    The app displays the shared plan and goals that had been set and allows Ms. Scarborough to capture information about her exercise sessions
    and share that information with Ms. Rocha.  Ms. Rocha is also able to send reading material and videos for Ms. Scarborough to review
    and short questionnaires to gather feedback about which exercises are working well for her and which aren't.  Ms. Scarborough receives notifications
    about these "to dos" on her app and marks them as complete and/or fills out the requested surveys as she has opportunity.  Both women also make adjustments
    to the exercise plan and goals - Ms. Scarborough to update the status, Ms. Rocha to set new objectives and make adjustments based on
    feedback and success to date.  This approach of asynchronous interaction and guidance helps Ms. Scarborough to achieve her exercise
    objectives within her busy schedule.
  </p>
  
  <a name="personal-trainer-fit"> </a>
  <h4>How this IG applies</h4>
  <p>
    Ms. Rocha uses a third-party secure FHIR server to manage information for her clients and <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}http.html#create">creates</a>
    <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}http.html#update">updates</a> the CarePlan and Goals, which comply with the 
    <a href="structuredefinition-pa-careplan.html">exercise plan</a> and <a href="structuredefinition-pa-goal.html">goal</a>.  Ms. Scarborough's app
    <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}search.html">searches</a> and, when appropriate also updates and (for goals) possibly even creates instances.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ms. Rocha's app also <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}http.html#create">creates</a> Task instances that comply with the 
    <a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.sdoh}}/StructureDefinition-SDOHCC-TaskForPatient.html">SDOH Task for Patient</a> profile to share the requests to
    review videos, documentation or to fill out forms.  Ms. Scarborough's app then <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}http.html#update">updates</a> the Tasks
    to indicate when they're done (or possibly refused).  If the Task was to fill out a form, the app would also render the Questionnaire and
    <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}http.html#create">create</a> (and sometimes <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}http.html#update">update</a>) a 
    QuestionnaireResponse complying with the relevant <a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.sdc}}index.html">SDC</a> profiles.

  <ul>
    <li>Rather than all data living on a shared server, there could be a separate server for Ms. Rocha's personal trainer system and a personal
