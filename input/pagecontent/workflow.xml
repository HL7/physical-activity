    This section of the specification talks about the different types systems and the specific workflows covered by this implementation guide.
  </p>
  <p>
    NOTE: Additional systems and/or workflows may be introduced in the future.  E.g. anonymized reporting, quality metric assessment, etc.
  </p>

  <h3>Actors</h3>
  <p>
    There are three specific types of systems that cooperate to help manage and improve patient physical activity levels.  They are:
	</p>
	<ul>
    <li><a href="CapabilityStatement-pa-care-manager.html">Care Managers</a> are electronic health record or similar systems used by physicians, 
      social workers, or others who have general responsibility for care of the patient.  These are the systems that will perform initial
      data capture, whose users may identify an issue with physical activity level, and will coordinate any interventions to improve
      physical activity level.</li>
    <li><a href="CapabilityStatement-pa-patient-engagement.html">Patient Engagment Apps</a> are systems that will be used by patients and/or their care givers
      to capture data to share with clinicians and physical activity specialists.  They will also allow patients and their representatives
      to see and potentially update plans of care related to physical activity.</li>
    <li><a href="CapabilityStatement-pa-referral-recipient.html">Referral Recipients</a> are systems used by physical activity professionals,
      such as personal trainers, community fitness centers, etc. who can provide services to patients to enhance and maintain their levels
      of physical activity.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    NOTE: Not all scenarios will necessarily involve all three types of systems.  For example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some patients will not have access to (or interest in using) a monitoring app and communication will solely be between the Care
       Manager and Referral Recipient systems.</li>
    <li>Some patients may not be interested in (or require) a referral to external exercise professionals and all interactions will take
      place solely between the Care Manager and Patient Engagement Apps.</li>
    <li>In some cases, Care Managers will act alone and not interact with other systems, though exposing their records over FHIR interfaces
      will still enable care transitions and other data sharing.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Workflows</h3>
  <p>
    This implementation guide covers two main workflows: <a href="#plans">Care planning</a> and <a href="#referral">Referral management</a>.
    Both are heavily informed by the workflows described in the 
    <a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.sdoh}}/sdoh_clinical_care_scope.html">Gravity SDOH IG</a>.  However, these flows and their associated
    artifacts have been adapted to reflect the needs of the physical activity space.
  </p>
  <p>
    NOTE: These workflows will frequently make reference to the 'patient' being involved in the process - as a source of data, as a
    participant in care planning, as a participant in interventions, etc.  In almost all circumstances, this should be read as 
    "the patient and/or their care giver(s)".  Information might be gathered from parents, guardians, or any other trusted person who
    has responsibility for the patient's care and/or are otherwise supporting the patient in meeting their healthcare objectives.  This 
    can even include caregivers being the focus of interventions, for example receiving training so they can better assist the patient in 
    the execution of their exercise plan.
  </p>
  
  <a name="plans"> </a>
  <h4>Physical Activity Care Planning</h4>
  <p>
    Care planning around physical activity follows a 'loop' pattern similar to all clinical care planning:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The patient is assessed to determine if there is an issue to be addressed.</li>
    <li>If an issue is found, the care provider works with the patient to determine a goal or set of goals to improve the current state and a plan to meet them</li>
    <li>The care provider and patient then work together to come up with a plan to meet those goals, possibly involving external interventions</li>
    <li>From time to time, the care provider and patient touch base to evaluate progress and, as necessary, make adjustments to the plan and goals</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    This may continue until the issue is deemed 'resolved' or until the patient determines they no longer wish to address the issue.  Alternatively,
    it may continue indefinitely, even when a target state has been reached, just to monitor and ensure ongoing success.
  </p>
  <p>Breaking these steps up into more detail</p>
  
  <a name="diagnosis"> </a>
  <h5>Issue identification</h5>
  <p>
    Some models might refer to this as 'diagnosis', but that word can be somewhat charged with connotations around 'who' is permitted to
    make such decisions.  In the context of this implementation guide, no specific rules are established around who 'authorized' to determine
    that a patient's level of physical activity is problematic.  However, some insurance plans or programs may introduce such expectations in order
    to authorize payment for interventions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, this implementation guide does not establish a hard and fast rule as to what constitutes 'sufficient' physical activity.  There
    are research guidelines that suggest ???? (TODO).  However, the fundamental determination of when intervention is appropriate is left up
    to care providers and patients to determine.  Comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiac risk factors, etc. may all
    come into play, either indicating that higher target levels or sometimes lower target levels are appropriate.  Payers may set rules for
    what criteria need to be met in order for interventions to be covered under particular plans.
  </p>
  <p>
    One key part of the preceding paragraph is that care providers and patients <i>together</i> make a determination as to whether a problem
    exists and requires intervention.  The cycle of setting goals, planning steps to achieve those goals and monitoring progress can only occur
    if the patient is on-board.  Absent that, a clinician can only note their concern in the chart, councel the patient, and follow up on
    subsequent visits to see if readiness may have changed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Typically the identification of an issue will begin with the capture of an exercise vital sign - either directly as observations
    (i.e. <a href="StructureDefinition-observation-evs-days-per-week.html">days/week</a> and 
    <a href="StructureDefinition-observation-evs-min-per-day.html">min/day</a>), using a 
    <a href="Questionnaire-questionnaire-evs.html">small Questionnaire</a>, or possibly incorporating those same questions as part of a larger 
    questionnaire (e.g. using <a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.sdc}}/modular.html">modular forms</a>).  This information might be recorded directly
    by the patient or by the care provider based on information solicited from the patient.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the care provider believes the patient's exercise level is problematic for their long-term health, they might choose to record a
    <a href="StructureDefinition-pa-condition.html">Condition</a> in the record indicating their concern, and to act as a focal point for subsequent
    plans, goals, and interventions.
  </p>
  
  <a name="plan"> </a>
  <p>
    The planning step involves coming to agreement with the patient about what their target should be for exercise frequency and duration, possibly
    with sub-targets along the way, as well as target timeframes for meeting those objectives.  Then the two need to agree on what steps will best help 
    the patient to get their exercise levels into the desired duration and frequency target range.  Historically, this plan would typically have been 
    captured as encounter notes within the care provider's system.  However, this guide sets higher expectations.
   </p>
   <p>
    To ensure appropriate ongoing coordination between care provider, patient, and exercise professionals, both the plan and any associated goals
    need to be shareable in a standardized manner.  The <a href="StructureDefinition-pa-careplan.html">exercise plan</a> is a simple structure 
    that captures the date, patient, author and a textual narrative describing the proposed plan the patient will follow.  Systems are free to
    capture and share additional discrete information if they wish, but only the minimum set of data described in this IG's profile need to be
    supported.  In some cases, the plan shared may carry more information than just information about exercise.  However, the plan <b>SHOULD</b>
    not contain any information that would be inappropriate for exercise professionals or others involved in the patient's exercise plan to see.
