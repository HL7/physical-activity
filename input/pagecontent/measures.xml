  <h3>Base measure</h3>
	<p>
    The foundational step in improving physical activity levels is having an agreed measure consistently used across EHRs to capture a
    patient's level of physical activity.  There are a wide variety of different types of physical activity and numerous different ways
    of capturing what activities were performed, and varying granularities with which the data can be captured.
	</p>
	<p>
	  While fine-grained and detailed records (e.g. exactly which type of exercise was performed, which muscle groups were activited, how
	  many repetitions were performed, how many intervals were done, etc.) are important for certain types of therapy and for research
	  purposes, they are too complex and onerous for wide-spread use and are not easily evaluatable from a perspective of "is this patient
	  sufficiently active to maintain good health?"
	</p>
	<p>
	  This guide therefore mandates the use of the very simple Exercise Vital Sign (LOINC <a href="loinc.org/89574-8/">89574-8</a> as the
	  primary measure of patient physical activity level for exchange and evaluation.  This measure [is super awesome because all of this
	  research says it works great - Laurie please provide text to fill in here].

	  The measure consists of two questions:
