    Step counts are only of interest insofar as they movement during moderate to high-intensity exercise - and the specific measurement of interest isn't actually the
    number of steps, but rather the time-period over which the high step-rate was occurring.  As such, a daily pedometer reading isn't terribly useful, though it might
    still act as a reminder.  If a high number of steps is an indication that the patient jogged that day and a low number of steps indicated that they probably didn't,
    it might still assist in their recollection of average number of days exercised, and possibly even average number of minutes per day.

    Step counts are more useful if they are associated with narrower periods of time, where a large number of steps per short period of time indicates jogging, power-walking,
    or other moderate to high-intensity exercise.

    The time captured can either be a specific period indicating both start and end, or a date, which nominally indicates the 'end'.  This dateTime SHOULD include a time
    component and SHALL always be precise down to the day.  Even if a period with a start and end are provided, a timeframe component is still required to ensure consistency
    in capturing the period of time.

    TODO: What are the guidelines for determining how many steps/period constitutes 'moderate to strenuous' exercise?
