    This scenario provides an example of the types of data exchanges that are described in the <a href="scenarios.html#pediatrics">Diabetic Pediatric 
    Patient Monitors Activity Level scenario</a> from the <a href="scenarios.html">Scenarios</a> page.</p>
  <p>
    The scenario shows the flows of information between the different systems
    and the various FHIR calls involved, as well as what the data might have looked like in each of the exchanges.  There are detailed tables below
    that provide details on each of the steps in the exchange as well as the types of data being shared.  From the <a href="#instances">instances</a>
    table, it's possible to navigate to sample XML and JSON instances.
