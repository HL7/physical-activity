    Daily exercise logs allow a patient to capture their exercise levels on a daily basis rather than on a 30-day estimate.  As such, the captured values are typically
    much more accurate.  The "minutes per day" of moderate to high intensity exercise might be recorded on the actual day of the exercise or on some subsequent day (ideally
    with relatively close proximity to the day on which the exercise occurred).  Like the monthly measures, daily activity logs can also have dependencies on other
    measurements, such as step counts or heart rate measurements.

    While the ideal would be to have a record for each day in the month of how many minutes were exercised (even if the amount was zero), reality will likely be that some
    days will be missed.  Even so, such records will make it easier to estimate the monthly days/week and minutes/day for a given monthly period.
