    Average heart rates are only of interest insofar as they reflect time exercised.  This measure captures both the average heart rate, as well as the duration over which
    that average was taken.  This number of minutes SHOULD reflect the "period of exercise".  For systems that measure heart-rate on a continuous basis, they will need
    to differentiate between heart rate elevations related to physical activity vs. those from forms of excitement.
  </p>
  <p>
    The time captured can either be a specific period indicating both start and end, or a date, which nominally indicates the 'end'.  This dateTime SHOULD include a time
    component and SHALL always be precise down to the day.  Even if a period with a start and end are provided, a timeframe component is still required to ensure consistency
    in capturing the period of time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some systems may choose to break a single exercise session into multiple heart-rate periods, differentiating moderate and high-intensity periods.
  </p>
  <p>
    TODO: What are the guidelines for determining when 'moderate to high' starts?  ends?  Are there variations by age, gender, or other patient-specific factor?
