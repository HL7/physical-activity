    This example instance represents a version-specific snapshot of a resource used as part of one of the ExampleScenarios in this
    IG.  Because of limitations of the publication process, every example instance is required to have a distinct Resource.id.  However,
    if this were a real exchange, all versions of the resource would have the <i>same</i> Resource.id and would instead have different
    Resource.meta.version values.  Therefore, when thinking about how this instance would be used in a 'real' set of systems, please
    pretend that the 'Vx' on the end of the resource id wasn't there, and that instead, the 'x' appears as the Resource.meta.version
    value for the resource.
  </p>
  <p>
    Be aware that not all systems will use sequential integers for their version numbers.  That convention
    has been used here to keep the examples as understandable as possible.  Similarly, real-world resource ids will generally not be meaningful
    as they are here.  Integers or UUIDs will be more typical.
