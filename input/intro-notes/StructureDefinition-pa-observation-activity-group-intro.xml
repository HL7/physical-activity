    This Observation helps to organize the various <a href="measures.html#activity">activity-based measures</a> so that it is easy to identify what
    measures are associated with the same physical activity episode (run, swim, work-out, etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
    NOTE: While this guide defines a standardized code for the organization of physical activity information, additional codings can
    also be used if they are appropriate for the same collection of information.  As well, observations may be collected under other
    'grouping' observations if there's a desire to organize collected data in alternate ways.  (E.g. an Observation with members that
    list all 'running' durations in a particular time-period.)
