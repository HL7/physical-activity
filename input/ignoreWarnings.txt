# All of these observations largely comply with the US Core R6 "Simple Observation" profile, which is not available in the 3.1.1 release used by this IG
# The only exception is that the physical activity profiles do not have the 'derivedFrom' element marked as mustSupport.  In general, these observations will always be recorded directly
# and not derived.  The high-level vital sign summaries *could* potentially be derived from a QuestionnaireResponse, but this is not supported in US Core 6.0.0, and even if it were,
# the physical activity use-case doesn't care about this relationship enough to impose it as a mustSupport.

# This *does* derive from the US core profile - the one in 3.1.1, not 6.0.0.  The only deviation from the 6.0.0 "US Core Condition Problems and Health Concerns Profile" is that there is no
# mustSupport on the SDOH category because the physical activity profile is constrained to a condition that is definitely not an SDOH condition.

# There is no ServiceRequest profile in 3.1.1, however physical activity complies with the 6.0.0 profile, with the exception that it does not constrain ServiceRequest.reason to *only*
# allow US Core profiles.  It mandates support for a specific US-core-derived slice, but allows any legal resource as a reason for the referral in the "non-must-support" space.  (US Core should probably do this too...)
